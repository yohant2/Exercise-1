Exercise 1 

# Navigate to your "Documents" folder
cd ~/Documents

# Create a new folder called "quick-exercise"
mkdir quick-exercise

# Navigate into that folder
cd quick-exercise

# Using the text-edit of your choice (e.g., Atom), create a new (empty) file
# called "constitution.txt" inside the "quick-exercise" folder you made
# No command for this one!

# List the contents of the folder to verify the new file is there
ls

# Search online for the text of the US Constitution (while it's still around!)
# and paste it into the "constitution.txt" file you created. Save your changes in
# the editor.
# No command for this one either!
