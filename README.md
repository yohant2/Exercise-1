**Exercise-1**

# Navigate to your "Documents" directory


# Create a new folder called "quick-exercise"


# Navigate into the "quick-exercise" folder you just created


# Using the text-edit of your choice (e.g., Atom), create a new (empty) file
# called "constitution.txt" inside the "quick-exercise" folder you made


# List the contents of the folder to verify the new file is there


# Search online for the text of the US Constitution and paste it into the 
# "constitution.txt" file you created. Save your changes through the editor.


# Display the contents of the "constitution.txt" file in the terminal
# Hint: use the `less` command so you can easily scroll up and down.
# For windows users: use the `more` command. 


# Navigate to the "Desktop" folder for your machine


# Display the contents of the "Documents/quick-exercise/constitution.txt" file in the Terminal
# *without changing directories again!*
